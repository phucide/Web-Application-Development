# 1. INTRODUCTION:
## 1.1. Motivation:
Today, the world is developing rapidly after the 4.0 revolution - the revolution in technology. Social services appear on the market more and more and most are executed quickly. Seizing this opportunity, many young entrepreneurs, business man have wished to develop their own service so that they can keep up with the trend and contribute to the development of the world.

However, in order for a service to become popular and widely used by users, many factors must be considered, especially about E-commerce services through shopping online. And for a shop manager to be able to manage products, customers and orders is an extremely important factor.

That's why our team made a simple website for a shopping online system. This web will assist the storekeeper in managing customers' information, and products as well as allowing them to perform tasks such as updating products,  ordering, and confirming orders. With the hope that this website is somewhat helpful in managing customer accounts and products, our goal is to construct a website where the flow of information is transparent enough for appropriate internal administration.

## 1.2. Problem Statement:
Handling personnel information manually presents a variety of issues. This is visible in procedures like order management, where a store manager must manually record the items ordered by the customer. The usage of paperwork in some of these procedures may result in human mistakes, papers may wind up in the wrong hands, and not to mention that it is time demanding. Customer self-service is lacking in some existing systems, which implies that customers cannot access and follow their personal information without going to the nearest store. 

Building and installing a shopping online system can handle the aforementioned concerns. This solution will keep the customer's information and only allow authorized users access to it. The project's purpose is to create a system that contains customer information and products to help administrators monitor customers’ accounts and orders.

## 1.3. Scope:
The scope of this project will be limited to the following:

1. Both customer and administrator login through the website
2. Customer personal profiles: Customers will have access to their profiles and their orders.
3. Homepage: The customers can use the filter to sort the products according to the lowest to highest price. They can also classify products according to other criterions. Users can decide whether they will buy more products or not. The user will get an invoice which contains the user’s name after making a purchase. The system can allow ordering from different suppliers according to availability
4. Admin Dashboard: The manager will be able search for customers, update the products, confirm the orders
